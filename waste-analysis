#Analysis
#Question 1: The query would classify regions into waste management performance categories based on the total waste generated.The output of this query will give you the total waste per region, along with a classification of how each region performs in terms of waste management.

SELECT 
    region, 
    SUM(waste_amount) AS total_waste,
    CASE
        WHEN SUM(waste_amount) < 1000 THEN 'Low Waste'
        WHEN SUM(waste_amount) BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000 THEN 'Moderate Waste'
        ELSE 'High Waste'
    END AS Waste_Performance_Category
FROM 
    waste_data
GROUP BY 
    region;

#Question 2:is designed to identify regions with average waste above a certain threshold (500) by using the HAVING clause.The average amount of waste per region (calculated by AVG(waste_amount)

SELECT 
    region, 
    AVG(waste_amount) AS average_waste
FROM 
    waste_data
GROUP BY 
    region
HAVING 
    AVG(waste_amount) > 500;

#Question 3:Find facilities in the dataset that meet the following criteria:

Are located in the Midwest region and generate more than 1,000 tons of waste, or
Are located in the South region and generate less than 500 tons of waste.

SELECT 
    facility_name, 
    region, 
    waste_amount
FROM 
    waste_data
WHERE 
    (region = 'Midwest' AND waste_amount > 1000)
    OR 
    (region = 'South' AND waste_amount < 500);

#This anaylsis can help
#Targeting High-Waste Areas: Focus on facilities with high waste for improvement.
#Learning from Low-Waste Facilities: Replicate best practices from efficient regions.
#Improving Efficiency: Identify waste-related inefficiencies to reduce costs.
#Enhancing Sustainability: Align efforts with eco-friendly goals for better consumer appeal.
#Meeting Regulations: Ensure compliance with environmental laws in different regions.
